I added a map that map building's full name to its abbreviated name and 
added a method that allows getting the abbreviated name by passing in 
its full name. By doing so, the drop-down menu can show full name to 
user while the view translates from full name to abbreviated name and 
then to the coordinates internally to meet the type of arguments of 
path finder. I also changed the return type of findShortestWalkingRoute 
since view doesn't need to know anything related to DGraph.
