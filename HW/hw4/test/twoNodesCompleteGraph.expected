# Test adding two nodes, two reflexive edges 
# and two edges between two nodes.

# Create a graph
created graph two_nodes_complete_graph

# Add two nodes
added node a to two_nodes_complete_graph
added node b to two_nodes_complete_graph

# Add four edges (including tow reflexive edges)
added edge AA from a to a in two_nodes_complete_graph
added edge AB from a to b in two_nodes_complete_graph
added edge BA from b to a in two_nodes_complete_graph
added edge BB from b to b in two_nodes_complete_graph

# Print the nodes in the graph, the outgoing edges from a, 
# and outgoing edges from b
two_nodes_complete_graph contains: a b
the children of a in two_nodes_complete_graph are: a(AA) b(AB)
the children of b in two_nodes_complete_graph are: a(BA) b(BB)
