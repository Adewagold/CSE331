# Same as twoNodesMultipleEdgesGraph.test, but 
# adding nodes in reverse order and adding edges 
# in non-alphabetical order to test if it prints 
# out in alphabetical order

# Create a graph
created graph two_nodes_multiple_edges_graph_alphabetical

# Add two nodes in reverse order
added node b to two_nodes_multiple_edges_graph_alphabetical
added node a to two_nodes_multiple_edges_graph_alphabetical

# Add five edges in non-alphabetical order
added edge AB1 from a to b in two_nodes_multiple_edges_graph_alphabetical
added edge BB from b to b in two_nodes_multiple_edges_graph_alphabetical
added edge AB2 from a to b in two_nodes_multiple_edges_graph_alphabetical
added edge BA from b to a in two_nodes_multiple_edges_graph_alphabetical
added edge AA from a to a in two_nodes_multiple_edges_graph_alphabetical

# Print the nodes in the graph, the outgoing edges from a, 
# and outgoing edges from b
two_nodes_multiple_edges_graph_alphabetical contains: a b
the children of a in two_nodes_multiple_edges_graph_alphabetical are: a(AA) b(AB1) b(AB2)
the children of b in two_nodes_multiple_edges_graph_alphabetical are: a(BA) b(BB)
