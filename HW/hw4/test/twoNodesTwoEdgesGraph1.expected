# Tests adding two nodes, one reflexive edge 
# and one edge between two nodes to graph.

# Create a graph
created graph two_nodes_two_edges_graph1

# Add two nodes
added node a to two_nodes_two_edges_graph1
added node b to two_nodes_two_edges_graph1

# Add two edges (including one reflexive edge)
added edge AA from a to a in two_nodes_two_edges_graph1
added edge AB from a to b in two_nodes_two_edges_graph1

# Print the nodes in the graph, the outgoing edges from a, 
# and outgoing edges from b
two_nodes_two_edges_graph1 contains: a b
the children of a in two_nodes_two_edges_graph1 are: a(AA) b(AB)
the children of b in two_nodes_two_edges_graph1 are:
