# Tests adding one node, reflexive edge to graph

# Create a graph
created graph one_node_one_edge_graph

# Add a node
added node a to one_node_one_edge_graph

# Add an edge
added edge AA from a to a in one_node_one_edge_graph

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from a
one_node_one_edge_graph contains: a
the children of a in one_node_one_edge_graph are: a(AA)
