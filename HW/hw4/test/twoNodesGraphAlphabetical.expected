# Same as twoNodeGraph.test, but reverse the 
# order of node adding to test if it prints 
# out in alphabetical order

# Create a graph
created graph two_nodes_graph_alphabetical

# Add two nodes in reverse alphabetical order
added node b to two_nodes_graph_alphabetical
added node a to two_nodes_graph_alphabetical

# Print the nodes in the graph, the outgoing edges from a, 
# and outgoing edges from b
two_nodes_graph_alphabetical contains: a b
the children of a in two_nodes_graph_alphabetical are:
the children of b in two_nodes_graph_alphabetical are:
