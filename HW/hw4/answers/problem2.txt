addNode and addEdge are needed in order to build the graph. containsNode 
are needed so that the graph won't have duplicate nodes. getNodes, 
childrenOf, isEmpty and size are included since it allows client to get 
some information about the graph. entrySet and toString are included since 
I feel that it'll be useful for the client to view the whole graph. 
Finally, removeEdge are included since I think some client might want to 
remove some edges after they are added.
