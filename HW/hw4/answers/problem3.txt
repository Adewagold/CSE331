Homework 4 - Problem 3

I used "0, 1, 2" case analysis mentioned in hints section 
to come up with many combinations, such as empty graph, 
one node graph, one node with reflexive edge graph, two 
nodes with two edges graph, and so on, for testing. 
I think I used clear-box testing to write tests since I've 
tried to cover every line of the code. I added some tests 
to the tests I wrote before writing implementation code 
since I found myself underconstrained a few methods' spec. 
For instance, I forgot to document @throws under the
condition when the client tries to pass in non-existing nodes 
as arguments of childrenOf and removeEdges; therefore, I 
added some tests to cover those conditions.
