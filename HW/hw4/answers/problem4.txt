The advantages of using collection of edges is O(1) time complexity when 
adding a new edge. The advantages of using an adjacency list is O(1) time 
complexity when adding a new vertex or adding a new edge. The advantages 
of using an adjacency matrix is O(1) time complexity when adding/removing 
edge or querying if the edge exists. I used a TreeSet to represent each 
node's outgoing edges and map each node to its set of edges using TreeMap 
since TreeMap and TreeSet can store the data in alphabetical order and 
guarantee O(logn) time complexity on basic operations, such as add, 
remove, and contains.
