a. No, they are different. The rep invariant generated by Daikon is 
   this.denom >= 0 while the rep invariant in RatNum is this.denom >= 0 && 
   r.numer/r.denom is in reduced form; in other words Daikon's output is 
   weaker than the true rep invariant.

b. The invariant generated by Daikon using RatNumTest is this.numer >= -1 && 
   arg != null && arg.numer >= -1 && arg.denom >= 0	while the invariant 
   generated by Daikon using RatNumSmallTest is this.numer >= -1 && 
   this.denom >= 1 && arg != null && arg.denom >= 1. RatNumTest covers the 
   case arg.denom == 0 and doesn't have constraint on this.denom, while the 
   RatNumSmallTest didn't cover arg.denom == 0 and have constraint on 
   this.denom that this.denom >= 1. Both cases show that RatNumSmallTest 
   didn't test the case where this or arg is NaN (denom == 0) when calling 
   sub method.
