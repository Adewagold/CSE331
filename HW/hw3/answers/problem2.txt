a. I only included a call to checkRep at the end of constructor since there's 
   no mutator method in the class, the instance variables are declared as 
   final (can only be initialized once), and all methods of arithmetic, 
   differentiate and antidifferentiate return a new RatTerm object without 
   modifying original object(s); therefore, checkRep at the end of constructor 
   is sufficient to hold rep invariant.
   
b. isZero should be change, and I would negate the coeff and then compare the 
   equality (using equals) with original coeff, which is more complex in terms 
   of code clarity since it uses two method call to determine if coeff is zero. 
   toString should add a check of isZero before checking e == 1 and then 
   append 0 to output if isZero is true, which is more complex since it needs 
   another condition check.
   
c. The constructor needs to be changed so that when passing in a NaN and any 
   exponent should be NaN instead of NaN*x^expt.
   
I prefer both since the rep invariant allows us to avoid terms such as 0*x^3 
and NaN*x^5 so that we don't need to worry about different representation of 
them when doing add, sub, mul, or div.
