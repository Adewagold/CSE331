loaded graph three_nodes_graph

# List nodes and edges to see if the graph is built correctly
three_nodes_graph contains: a b c
the children of a in three_nodes_graph are: b(AB)
the children of b in three_nodes_graph are: a(AB) c(BC)
the children of c in three_nodes_graph are: b(BC)

# Find the shortest path a to c
path from a to c:
a to b via AB
b to c via BC

# Find the shortest path c to a
path from c to a:
c to b via BC
b to a via AB
