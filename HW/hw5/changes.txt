I changed my implementation of graph from TreeMap<String, TreeSet<LabeledEdge>> 
to HashMap<String, HashSet<LabeledEdge>> since HashMap and HashSet have better 
performance (constant-time performance) for the basic operations (get and put). 
I also add /*@NonNull*/ and /*@Nullable*/ tags to satisfy the nullness checker.
