# Tests find minimum-cost path if two paths exist.

created graph two_nodes_two_edges_graph
added node node1 to two_nodes_two_edges_graph
added node node2 to two_nodes_two_edges_graph
added edge 1.000 from node1 to node2 in two_nodes_two_edges_graph
added edge 1.001 from node1 to node2 in two_nodes_two_edges_graph

path from node1 to node2:
node1 to node2 with weight 1.000
total cost: 1.000
